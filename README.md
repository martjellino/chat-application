# Chat Application
Chat Application is my final project of Back End Web Development Bootcamp from Dibimbing. The scenario is to be back end developer who create chat application starting from scratch with personal message and group message features.

## General Information
Generally the chat application uses javascript as programming language, node js as run time environment, express js as framework, adn MySQL as RDBMS. Client must register as user to create account. Then User can login with exact combination of email and password to access chat application. Users can create, read, and delete the messages but they are not permissible to update its created messages.
